# Script and Language Identification for Text-based Documents with Content Classification (NLP)

### Summary:
* Designed a multilingual document scanner software that can automatically identify the script and language of a document using a camera. Additionally, it can automatically categorize a document based on its content using Natural Language Processing techniques. The system was built entirely from first principles.

### Method: 
*	Utilized Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing algorithms to 1) extract text from a page; 2) identify the script; 3) determine the language; and 4) recognize and categorize the document’s content using (NLP).
*	Used 3 ANNs (Artificial Neural networks) to perform character recognition and text extraction.
*	Used a KNN machine learning algorithm and TF-IDF vectorization to categorize a document between 6 categories based on its content. 

### Results:
*	Classifies 3 scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek) with a 99% accuracy. (Ω, ё, Α, Ж, Д, ф, Δ).
*	Can identify text from 8 languages with a 97% accuracy (English, Indonesian, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Greek).
*	Identifies the Type of document based on its Content with 85% accuracy for 6 categories per language: (1) Patient Registration Forms 2) Non-Disclosure Agreements 3) Patient Registration Forms 4) Vaccination Cards 5) Hospital Food Menus 6) Doctor referral Letters.)
